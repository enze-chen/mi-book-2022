# Introduction to Materials Informatics

*Authors: [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/) and [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/) (University of California, Berkeley)*


This is a 3-week curriculum for one of three modules for a summer 2022 research internship in the [Materials Sciences Division](https://www2.lbl.gov/msd/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/).
It is designed using the open-source [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) software and interactivity is made possible with the generous support of the [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/) program at UC Berkeley (non-Berkeley students may also use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)).
