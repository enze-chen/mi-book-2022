# Day 01: Introductions


Welcome to the first day of Module 1! 
We're excited to learn with you. 🙌

```{attention}
If you haven't done so already, please make sure that you've completed the [introductory survey](https://forms.gle/o9wmGWkj4E1HmoQN8) and completed the {doc}`../../preamble/setup` instructions.
```

We also invite you to read through the {doc}`../../preamble/overview` and the condensed {doc}`Schedule <../../preamble/schedule>` to get a feel for what we'll be doing in this module. 
If you don't have time to do so, not to worry---we will clarify <s>everything</s>most things today. 🙂
