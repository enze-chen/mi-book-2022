**Description**: Dielectric materials are a subset of materials that are typically found in microelectronics due to their insulator-like properties. Their properties are partly due to the fact that dielectrics have wide band gaps, typically above 4 eV. Dielectrics are crucial in reducing the size of transistors and following the trend on Mooreâ€™s Law. Finding alternative dielectrics to SiO<sub>2</sub> is crucial since the current plan for transistor reduction results in quantum tunneling. In order to more efficiently find new materials that donâ€™t yet have dielectric constants in the Materials Project database, we turned to machine learning to help us predict dielectrics that can act as a substitute to SiO<sub>2</sub>. We ran linear regression and random forest models against known dielectrics and were able to produce compounds that had been proven to be dielectrics and others that havenâ€™t been tested experimentally.
