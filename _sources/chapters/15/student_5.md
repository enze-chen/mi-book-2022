**Description**: Moore's Law states that the number of transistors found in a densely packed circuit will double approximately every two years. In order to uphold Moore's Law, SiO<sub>2</sub> has become so thin that quantum tunnelling occurs. Thus, our group utilized machine learning to create and train a model using specified properties (including band gap, density and crystal structure) to predict superior dielectrics to be utilized instead of SiO<sub>2</sub>. We found substantial evidence that there are other dielectric materials that could replace SiO<sub>2</sub> in transistors and allow Moore's Law to be maintained.
